# Exercise 5

## Basic promptfoo

Check out `./promptfooconfig.yaml` for the tests that are being run.

Run them with `npm run promptfoo:examples` and start the Promptfoo UI with `npm run promptfoo:ui` to see the output.

Experiment with different prompts, models, and assertions.

You can see the available Promptfoo Assertions and how to use them in the documentation here: https://www.promptfoo.dev/docs/configuration/expected-outputs/#assertion-types

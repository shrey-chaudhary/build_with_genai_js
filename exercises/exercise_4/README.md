# Exercise 4

## Augmenting and generating

In `./src/index.js` use your vector search function to get the context for the user input.

Form a prompt that includes the context and the user query.

Pass the prompt to the model instead of the original `userInput`.

Start asking your bot hard questions about the fictitious products that we loaded into the database.

Experiment further with:

- The model parameters and system prompt
- the number of documents to return, is more or fewer better?
- The prompt (does it help to tell the model what to do or what not to do?)

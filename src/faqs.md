- **Function:** A wall surface that can instantly change color or display projected content, designed to act as an adaptive greenscreen or dynamic backdrop.
- **Problem:** The projected "greenscreen" color bleeds onto the subject, or displayed content looks washed out.
- **Troubleshooting:**
  1.  Ensure even lighting on the Smart Wall surface; avoid hotspots or shadows.
  2.  Calibrate the wall's color profile using the provided calibration tool.
  3.  Adjust the distance between the subject and the wall; increase slightly if bleed is an issue.
  4.  In the keying software, adjust the spill suppression settings.
  5.  Update the ChromaKey Smart Wall firmware and control software.

**Title:** ThoughtStream Dictation Accuracy Issues

- **Device/Software:** ThoughtStream Dictation (Software/Headset)
- **Function:** Uses EEG signals captured by a headset to transcribe thoughts directly into text.
- **Problem:** Transcribed text is inaccurate, slow, or contains many nonsensical words.
- **Troubleshooting:**
  1.  Ensure the headset sensors have good, clean contact with the scalp.
  2.  Perform the mandatory focus and calibration exercises within the ThoughtStream software regularly.
  3.  Minimize external distractions and try to focus clearly on the words/concepts you want to transcribe.
  4.  Update the ThoughtStream software and AI transcription models.
  5.  Build up the custom user dictionary with specific terms or names you use frequently.

**Title:** Reality Overlay Glasses Alignment Drift

- **Device/Software:** Reality Overlay Glasses (Peripheral)
- **Function:** Augmented reality glasses that overlay contextual information directly onto the user's view of the real world.
- **Problem:** The digital overlay drifts out of alignment with the real-world objects it refers to.
- **Troubleshooting:**
  1.  Perform the spatial calibration sequence for the glasses in the current environment.
  2.  Ensure the glasses' cameras and sensors are clean and unobstructed.
  3.  Check for and minimize reflective surfaces or repetitive patterns in the environment that could confuse tracking.
  4.  Restart the Reality Overlay Glasses and the connected host device (phone/PC).
  5.  Update the glasses' firmware and the overlay application software.

**Title:** OmniSound Earbuds Unstable Spatial Audio

- **Device/Software:** OmniSound Earbuds (Peripheral)
- **Function:** Earbuds using head-tracking to provide stable spatial audio, making sound sources seem fixed in space even when the user moves their head.
- **Problem:** The spatial audio effect shifts inappropriately or doesn't track head movements correctly.
- **Troubleshooting:**
  1.  Ensure earbuds are seated correctly and securely in the ears.
  2.  Recalibrate the head tracking feature via the OmniSound companion app.
  3.  Check the Bluetooth connection stability between the earbuds and the source device.
  4.  Update the OmniSound earbud firmware and app.
  5.  Ensure the audio source content actually supports spatial audio.

**Title:** Data Sieve Filtering Incorrect Data Types

- **Device/Software:** Data Sieve Pro (Software)
- **Function:** A data cleansing tool that automatically identifies and separates different types of data (e.g., PII, financial, technical) within large datasets.
- **Problem:** The tool misidentifies data types, putting sensitive data in the wrong category or failing to flag it.
- **Troubleshooting:**
  1.  Review and refine the pattern recognition rules used by Data Sieve.
  2.  Ensure the AI model has been trained on representative samples of your specific data types.
  3.  Adjust the confidence threshold for data classification in the settings.
  4.  Manually review a sample of the classified data and correct errors to provide feedback to the system.
  5.  Update Data Sieve Pro to the latest version with improved algorithms.

**Title:** Volumetric Display Projector Calibration Error

- **Device/Software:** VoluDisplay Projector (Peripheral)
- **Function:** Projects a true 3D volumetric image into a transparent containment field.
- **Problem:** The projected image appears distorted, warped, or doesn't align correctly within the containment field.
- **Troubleshooting:**
  1.  Ensure the containment field unit is clean, undamaged, and positioned correctly relative to the projector.
  2.  Run the projector's automatic calibration sequence.
  3.  Check that the specialized VoluLink cable is securely connected at both ends.
  4.  Update the VoluDisplay firmware and the host PC's graphics drivers.
  5.  Ensure the viewing room has controlled, dim lighting as specified in the manual.
